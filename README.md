# Final-year-steganography-cryptography-project

Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information.  For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques.
